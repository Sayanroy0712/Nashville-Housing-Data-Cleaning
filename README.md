# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

In the Nashville housing data cleaning project using SQL, I began by importing raw datasets from various sources, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process. Employing SQL queries, I standardized formats, handled missing values, and eliminated duplicate entries to create a clean and reliable dataset. I performed data profiling to identify potential anomalies and outliers, allowing for data validation and verification.

Through SQL transformations, I enriched the dataset with additional relevant attributes, such as nearby amenities and property features, enhancing the analysis scope. Utilizing SQL aggregations, I computed key housing market metrics, like average property prices and trends over time. The clean dataset became the foundation for insightful visualizations using Tableau, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions in Nashville's real estate market.

Overall, this project showcases the power of SQL in data cleaning and preparation, leading to a robust dataset for deeper analysis and data-driven insights into Nashville's housing market.
